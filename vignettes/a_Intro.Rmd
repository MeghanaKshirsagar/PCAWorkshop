# Introduction

Principal component analysis (PCA) provides a method for visualizing the distinguishing patterns or information in a dataset.  Additional tutorials will provide a more in-depth review of the method, this is just a short and sweet "taster" vignette. 


#  Dataset: Winetasting in Bordeaux
We will use a very simple example dataset of wine-tasting where 200 judges performed a blind tasting of 5 red wines from Bordeaux, scoring each as boring, mediocre, good or excellent. 

The dataset is available in the `ade4` R package:

```{r}
data(bordeaux)
```

In French wines, table wine has fewer legal restrictions and is cheaper, whereas Cru and Grand Cru wine have more regulation standards and therefore are more expensive.

```{r bordeaux, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A simple dataset example", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/Bordeaux1.png")
```

```{r}
data(bordeaux)
df<-bordeaux %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var="Wine") %>%
  reshape2::melt(.,variable.name="Judge_Score",
                 value.name="Number")
df
```


## Simple Data visualization with a barplot.. (and a fun graphics with `ggpomological`)

Data visualization is important and always a good first step with any dataset, even simple ones. Lets visualize this data, with a simple barplot, before we apply PCA. To make it more interesting we will use the  `ggpomological` graphics ggtheme, to display these wine data. Pomology is a branch of botany that studies and cultivates fruit   [ggpomological](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/ggpomological) is a pomology ggtheme and palette that evokes the style and colors of old watercolor prints of pomology. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/ggpomological")
#install.packages("magick")

p<- ggplot(df,
           aes(Judge_Score, Number, fill=Judge_Score))+
    geom_bar(color="black",stat = "identity") +
    facet_wrap(~Wine, nrow = 2)+
    scale_fill_pomological()+
    theme_pomological("Homemade Apple", 12)+
    theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.key = element_rect(colour = "black"))

 paint_pomological(p,res = 110) %>%
   magick::image_write("barplot-painted.png")
```



```{r pomological, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="pomological ggplot bordeaux dataset", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/barplot-painted.png")
```


# Running PCA or SVD

We will show two quick approaches to run PCA.  
* First we will apply SVD to the z-score scaled data. We will scale the data with `center=TRUE, scale=TRUE` and run singular value decomposition (SVD). This generates 3 matrices, U, D, V.  D is a diagonal matrix, with the eigenvalues. U and V are the left and right singular values, which include the scores of the rows and columns in the reduced space. 


```{r}
bordeauxS= scale(bordeaux,center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
s= svd(bordeauxS)
s$u %*% diag(s$d) %*% t(s$v) #  X = U D V'
```

The first component (PC1, horizontal) captured almost 77% of the variance or information in the data, and shows that boring/medicore wines were distinct from good/excellent, with Vin de table (Table Wine) and Vin de marque (Brand Wine) associated with the former descriptions. Regional Bordeaux wine (Bordeaux d'origine) was close to the origin, with Cru and Grand Cru wines associated with good/excellent terms

The second component represented 18% of the variance, and mostly distinguished boring from medicore wine.  There was little distinction between good and excellent on PC 2. 


```{r pca, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="PCA of bordeaux dataset", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/bordeaux_pca.png")
```

* The above is PCA, but we can perform the same calculation by as calling a PCA function, for example if we call PCA is the R package `ade4`.  

```{r}
score(dudi.pca(bordeaux, scan = FALSE))
```

We will learn about the different R packages that run PCA, in the second vignette Principal Component Analysis in R and will apply PCA to genomics data in the 4th vignette of the workshop;  PCA example: scRNAseq. 

# Visualization of Results; Explor, pcaExplorer 

## Explor
Julien Barnier's package `explor` provides a nice shiny interface to explore matrix factorization results including PCA, Correspondence analysis, or Multiple correspondence analysis and other dimension reduction methods available in R packages `ade4`, `vegan`, `FactoMineR`, `GDATools`, `MASS`, `stats` (`prcomp` or `princomp`)

```{r explor, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Explor", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/explor.png")
```


## pcaExplorer
Federico Marini and Harald Binder have create a Bioconductor package called `pcaExplorer`

```{r pcaExplorer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="PCA of bordeaux dataset", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./image/pcaExplor.png")
```


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
